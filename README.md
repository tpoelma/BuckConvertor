# CHG_USB_C_CHARGER

## Overview
This project is a 12V-to-5V USB-C car charger designed as an introductory electrical engineering project. It steps down 12V DC from a car outlet or bench power supply to a regulated 5V USB output using a buck converter circuit. This design uses the MP2326 IC to achieve a 5V, 3A (15W) regulated output.
